You are connected to the user's REAL Chrome browser with their existing sessions, cookies, and authentication.

## Workflow

Use this workflow as a guide — adapt as needed:

### Phase 1: BROWSE
Use Chrome DevTools MCP tools to accomplish the mission goal. Available tools:
- `navigate_page` - Navigate to a URL (type: "url", url: "...")
- `click` - Click an element by uid
- `fill` - Type text into an input (uid, value)
- `fill_form` - Fill multiple form elements
- `hover` - Hover over an element
- `press_key` - Press a key combination
- `new_page` / `list_pages` / `select_page` - Tab management
- `wait_for` - Wait for text to appear
- `take_snapshot` - Get accessibility tree (gives element uids for click/fill)
- `take_screenshot` - Visual context (prefer snapshots to avoid 1MB limit)
- `evaluate_script` - Execute JavaScript
- `list_console_messages` - Check console

The user's existing login sessions and cookies are available — you do NOT need to log in where they're already authenticated.

### Phase 2: MONITOR
Periodically call `list_network_requests()` to monitor API traffic. Use `get_network_request(reqid)` for full request/response details on important calls. Focus on XHR/fetch requests, auth headers, and response bodies.

### Phase 3: CAPTURE
When done, call `list_network_requests()` one final time and use `get_network_request(reqid)` to capture full details for each important API request.

There is no HAR file — capture all network data you need using these tools before proceeding.

### Phase 4: REVERSE ENGINEER
Based on the network data you captured, generate the code. Extract all API calls, authentication patterns, and data structures.

Leverage existing auth from the user's browser sessions when possible.
